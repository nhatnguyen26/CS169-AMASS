      People all over the world are working in various capacities to bring about greater social good. Whether it is Habitat for Humanity’s organizational effort to build homes for the poor or an independent researcher’s investigation of dislocated communities, these compelling stories all need to be told.

With a single powerful video, individuals and social impact organizations can effectively broadcast their missions, scale and garner support for their work, and raise money. However, professional videography is expensive and no credible platform currently exists to find freelance videography work.

Amass Media aims to empower organizations and individuals to tell their social impact stories by creating a credible platform that connects individuals and social impact organizations with early career filmmakers looking to build their portfolios and make a difference.

Linking these two groups, Amass Media makes video storytelling accessible to all and gives the world an opportunity to see and support social impact in action. If you're interested, sign up and we'll let you know when it's ready to go.
